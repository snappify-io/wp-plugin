# Snappify WP
Official WordPress plugin for snappify (developed by [Aptex - #wirmachensoftware](https://aptex.de))

This is a work in progress.

For now the plugin provides a custom Gutenberg block that takes a public snap URL to render the snap inside your WordPress.
More functionality like an Elementor widget will come in the future.
